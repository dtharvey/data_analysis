<h2>Part IV. Ways to Model Data</h2>

<h3>Investigation 19: The Binomial Distribution</h3>

<p><em>Binomial Distribution.</em> A binomial distribution describes the probability, \(P\), of a particular event, \(X\), during a fixed number of trials, \(N\), given the probability, \(p\), that the event happens during a single trial. Mathematically, we express the binomial distribution as</p>

<div class="equation">\[P(X,N)=\frac { N! }{ X!(N-X)! } \times { p }^{ X }\times { \left( 1-p \right)  }^{ N-X }\]</div>

<p>where \(!\) is the factorial symbol. The theoretical mean, \(\mu \), and the theoretical variance, \({ \sigma }^{ 2 }\),for a binomial distribution are</p>

<div class="equation">\[\mu =Np\quad \quad \qquad \quad { \sigma  }^{ 2 }=Np\left( 1-p \right) \]</div>

<a name="Inv19"></a><p class="investigation"><strong>Investigation 19.</strong> The box and whisker plot in <a href="investigation06.html#Fig1">Figure 1</a> includes data from the analysis of 30 samples of 1.69-oz bags of plain M&amp;Ms. Collectively, the samples have 1699 M&amp;Ms, of which 435 are yellow. If you pick one M&amp;M at random from these 1699 M&amp;Ms, what is the probability, p, that it is yellow? Suppose that this probability applies to the population of all plain M&amp;Ms. If we draw a sample of five M&amp;Ms from this population, what is the probability that the sample contains no yellow M&amp;Ms? Repeat for each of 1â€“5 yellow M&amp;Ms. Construct a histogram of your results and report the mean and the variance. Repeat this analysis for green M&amp;Ms. Compare your two histograms and discuss their similarities and their differences. Using the data in <a href="investigation06.html#Table2">Table 2</a>, comment on the suitability of the binomial distribution for modeling the number of yellow M&amp;Ms in samples of five M&amp;Ms.</p>
