<h2>Part IV. Ways to Model Data</h2>

<h3>Investigations 20 and 21: The Poisson Distribution</h3>

<p><em>Poisson Distribution.</em> The binomial distribution is useful if we wish to model the probability of finding a fixed number of yellow M&amp;Ms in a sample of M&amp;Ms of fixed size, but not the probability of finding a fixed number of yellow M&Ms in a single bag.</p>

<a name="Inv20"></a><p class="investigation"><strong>Investigation 20.</strong> Explain why we cannot use the binomial distribution to model the distribution of yellow M&amp;Ms in 1.69-oz bags of plain M&amp;Ms.</p>

<p>To model the number of yellow M&amp;Ms in packages of M&amp;Ms, we use the Poisson distribution, which gives the probability of a particular event, \(X\), given an average rate, \(\lambda \), for that event. Mathematically, we express the Poisson distribution as</p>

<div class="equation">\[P\left( X,\lambda  \right) =\frac { { e }^{ -\lambda  }{ \lambda  }^{ X } }{ X! } \]</div>

<p>The theoretical mean, \(\mu \), and the theoretical variance, \({ \sigma  }^{ 2 }\), are both equal to \(\lambda\).</p>

<a name="Inv21"></a><p class="investigation"><strong>Investigation 21.</strong> The histograms in <a href="investigation12.html#Fig4">Figure 4</a> include data from the analysis of 30 samples of 1.69-oz bags of plain M&amp;Ms. Collectively, the samples have an average of 14.5 yellow M&amp;Ms per bag. Suppose this rate applies to the population of all 1.69-oz bags of plain M&amp;Ms. If you pick a 1.69-oz bag of plain M&amp;Ms at random, what is the probability that it contains exactly 11 yellow M&amp;Ms? Repeat for each of 0–29 yellow M&amp;Ms. Construct a histogram that shows the actual distribution of bags of M&amp;Ms for each of 0–29 yellow M&amp;Ms, using a bin size of 1 unit, and overlay a line plot that shows the predicted distribution of bags; be sure to you use the same scale for each plot’s <em>y</em>-axis. Comment on your results.</p>
