<h2>Part I. Ways to Describe Data</h2>

<h3>Investigations 4 and 5: Ratio/Interval Data &amp; Discrete/Continuous Data</h3>

<p>We also can use a numerical variable to assign samples to groups. For example, we can divide the plain M&amp;Ms in <a href="investigation0103.html#Table1">Table 1</a> into two groups based on the sample’s weight. What makes a numerical variable more interesting, however, is that we can use it to make quantitative comparisons between samples; thus, we can report that there are 14.8 times as many plain M&amp;Ms in a 10-oz. bag as there are in a 0.8-oz. bag. Although we can complete meaningful calculations using any numerical variable, the type of calculation we can perform depends on whether or not the variable’s values have an absolute reference.</p>

<a name="Inv04"></a><p class="investigation"><strong>Investigation 4.</strong> A numerical variable is described as either ratio or interval depending on whether it has (ratio) or does not have (interval) an absolute reference. Explain what it means for a variable to have an absolute reference and assign each of the numerical variables in <a href="investigation0103.html#Table1">Table 1</a> as either a ratio variable or an interval variable. Why might this difference be important?</p>

<a name="Inv05"></a><p class="investigation"><strong>Investigation 5.</strong> Numerical variables also are described as discrete or continuous. Define the terms discrete and continuous and assign each of the numerical variables in <a href="investigation0103.html#Table1">Table 1</a> to one of these terms.</p>
